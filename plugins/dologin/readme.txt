2FA login. Passwordless login. SMS passcode as 2nd step verification. GeoLocation (Continent/Country/City)/IP range to limit login attempts. Support Whitelist and Blacklist. Support WooCommerce.

== Description ==

In one click, your WordPress login page will be pretected with the smart brute force attack protection! Any login attempts more than 6 in 10 minutes (default value) will be limited.

Limit the number of login attempts through both the login and the auth cookies.

* Two-factor Authentication login.

* Text SMS message passcode for 2nd step verification support.

* Google reCAPTCHA.

* GeoLocation (Continent/Country/City) or IP range to limit login attempts.

* Passwordless login link.

* Support Whitelist and Blacklist.

* GDPR compliant. With this feature turned on, all logged IPs get obfuscated (md5-hashed).

* WooCommerce Login supported.

* XMLRPC gateway protection.

= API =

* Call the function `$link = function_exists( 'dologin_gen_link' ) ? dologin_gen_link( 'your plugin name or tag' ) : '';` to generate one passwordless login link for the current user.

* Call the function `$link = function_exists( 'dologin_gen_link' ) ? dologin_gen_link( 'note/tip for this generation', $user_id ) : '';` to generate a passwordless login link for the user which ID is `$user_id`.

The generated one-time used link will be expired after 7 days.

* Define const `SILENCE_INSTALL` to avoid redirecting to setting page after installtion.

= CLI =

* List all passwordless links: `wp dologin list`

* Generate a passwordless link for one username (for the login name `root`): `wp dologin gen root`

* Delete a passwordless link w/ the ID in list (for the record w/ ID 5): `wp dologin del 5`

= How GeoLocation works =

When visitors hit the login page, this plugin will lookup the Geolocation info from API, compare the Geolocation setting (if has) with the whitelist/blacklist to decide if allow login attempts.

== Privacy ==

The online IP lookup service is provided by https://www.doapi.us. The provider's privacy policy is https://www.doapi.us/privacy.

Based on the original code from Limit Login Attemps plugin and Limit Login Attemps Reloaded plugin.
