== Description ==

Profile Builder is WordPress registration done right.

**Like this plugin?** Consider leaving a [5 star review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/profile-builder?filter=5).

It lets you customize your website by adding a Front-end menu for all your users,
giving them a more flexible way to modify their user-information or register new users (front-end registration).
Also, grants users with administrator rights to customize basic user fields or add custom ones.

To achieve this, just create a new page and give it an intuitive name(i.e. Edit Profile).
Now all you need to do is add the following shortcode(for the previous example): [wppb-edit-profile].
Publish the page and you are done!

You can use the following shortcodes:

* **[wppb-edit-profile]** - to grant users front-end access to their personal information (requires user to be logged in).
* **[wppb-login]** - to add a front-end log-in form.
* **[wppb-register]** - to add a front-end registration form.
* **[wppb-recover-password]** - to add a password recovery form.

Users with administrator rights have access to the following features:

* add a custom stylesheet/inherit values from the current theme or use one of the following built into this plugin: default, white or black.
* select whether to display or not the admin bar in the front end for a specific user-group registered to the site.
* select which information-field can users see/modify. The hidden fields values remain unmodified.
* add custom fields to the existing ones, with several types to choose from: heading, text, textarea, select, checkbox, radio, and/or upload.
* add an avatar upload for users.
* create custom redirects
* front-end userlisting using the **[wppb-list-users]** shortcode.
* role editor: add, remove, clone and edit roles and also capabilities for these roles.
* private website functionality: restrict access to only logged in users

NOTE:

This plugin only adds/removes fields in the front-end. The default information-fields will still be visible(and thus modifiable) from the back-end, while custom fields will only be visible in the front-end.



== Installation ==

1. Upload the profile-builder folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a new page and use one of the shortcodes available

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I navigated away from Profile Builder and now I can�t find it anymore; where is it? =

	Profile Builder can be found in the default menu of your WordPress installation below the �Users� menu item.

= Why do the custom WordPress fields still show up, even though I set it to be "hidden"? =

	Profile Builder only disables the default fields in the front-end of your site/blog, it does absolutely nothing in the dashboard.

= I entered the serial number I received in the confirmation e-mail, but the indicator still is red. What�s wrong? =

	The validation, as well as the update checks require an active internet connection. If you are currently working on a localhost, check your internet connection. If you, however, are on a live server and your serial number won't validate, it means that either our servers are/were down or your server blocked the validation request.

= I see that there is a heading in the Extra Profile Fields section of Profile Builder, but it isn�t displaying in the front-end, neither in the back-end. How come? =

	If you mean the default Header item "Extra Profile Fields", as long as you don't change the title, it won't show up.

= I deleted the default header from the Extra Profile Fields section, but when I refreshed the page, it was there again. Am I seeing things? =

	Luckily for you, you aren't imagining it! The plugin is designed in such way, that there must always be a header item in the list. But don't worry: your users won't see the default header.


= I can't find a question similar to my issue; Where can I find support? =
