Adds a Dashboard widget that displays the latest messages from your PHP error log. It can also send logged errors to email.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a Dashboard widget that displays the latest messages from your PHP error log. It can also send you email notifications about newly logged errors.

**Features**

* Automatically detects error log location.
* Explains how to configure PHP error logging if it's not enabled yet.
* The number of displayed log entries is configurable.
* Sends you email notifications about logged errors (optional).
* Configurable email address and frequency.
* You can easily clear the log file.
* The dashboard widget is only visible to administrators.
* Optimized to work well even with very large log files.

**Usage**

Once you've installed the plugin, go to the Dashboard and enable the "PHP Error Log" widget through the "Screen Options" panel. The widget should automatically display the last 20 lines from your PHP error log. If you see an error message like "Error logging is disabled" instead, follow the displayed instructions to configure error logging.

Email notifications are disabled by default. To enable them, click the "Configure" link in the top-right corner of the widget and enter your email address in the "Periodically email logged errors to:" box. If desired, you can also change email frequency by selecting the minimum time interval between emails from the "How often to send email" drop-down.

= 1.7.4 =
* Updated the Freemius SDK to version 2.5.3 in the hopes of fixing a couple of PHP 8.1 deprecation notices that appear to be triggered by the SDK.

= 1.7.3 =
* Fixed a number of PHP 8 deprecation warnings and compatibility issues.
* Tested with WP 6.1.

* Added an "Ignored regular expressions" setting. Enter one or more regex patterns in the box and the plugin will hide log entries that match any of those patterns.

= 1.7.1 =
* Added a "Clear Fixed Messages" button.
* Fixed a scheduling bug where, in certain configurations, the plugin would send some email notifications too late.
* Fixed a security issue.
* Tested with WP 5.9.1 and 6.0-alpha (briefly).

= 1.7 =
* Added a "mark as fixed" option. Like the "ignore" option, "mark as fixed" hides all existing copies of a specific error. However, if the same error happens again in the future, the plugin will make it visible again.

* Fixed "Deprecated: contextual_help is deprecated since version 3.3.0". While this plugin doesn't use the "contextual_help" filter, it includes a copy of scbFramework that can also be used by other active plugins. Some of those plugins could run code in scbFramework that used "contextual_help". This deprecated code has now been removed.

* Tested with WP 5.5.1 and 5.6-beta.

= 1.6.11 =
* Changed the minimum required PHP version to 5.6.

= 1.6.9 =
* Fixed the erorr "call to undefined function get_blog_list()" when trying to access the network admin on a non-Multisite site.

= 1.6.8 =
* Fixed a conflict with WP-PageNavi, again. The fix included in the previous version was not fully effective.

= 1.6.7 =
* Fixed a conflict with WP-PageNavi that could cause a fatal error.
* Updated Freemius SDK to the latest version, which may fix some Freemius-related issues.
* Tested up to WP 5.3.

* Added a workaround for conflicts with plugins that use old versions of scbFramework.
* Tested up to WP 5.2.

= 1.6.5 =
* Fixed a bug where it wasn't possible to filter out log entries that didn't match any of the standard severity levels (notice, warning, error, etc). Now you can hide uncategorized log entries by unchecking the "Other" option in filter settings.
* Fixed a security issue.
* Tested with the final WP 5.1 release.

= 1.6.4 =

* Tested with the final WP 5.0 release.

= 1.6.2 =

* Fixed a bug where activating the plugin on individual sites in a Multisite network could, in some cases, trigger a fatal error.
* Additional testing with WP 5.0-alpha.

= 1.6.1 =
* Fixed the "upgrade" link being broken in certain configurations.

= 1.6 =
* Added a colored dot showing the severity level to each error message. Fatal errors are red, warnings are orange, notices and strict-standards messages are grey, and custom or unrecognized messages are blue.
* Added a new setting for email notifications: "how often to check the log for new messages". 
* Added a notice explaining how to configure WordPress to log all types of errors (including PHP notices) instead of just fatal errors and warnings.
* Added Freemius integration.
* Added a link to the Pro version to bottom of the widget.
* Improved parsing of multi-line log entries. Now the plugin will show all of the lines as part of the same message instead of treating every line as an entirely separate error.
* Improved stack trace formatting.
* In Multisite, the dashboard widget now also shows up in the network admin dashboard.
* Changed permissions so that only Super Admins can change plugin settings or clear the log file. Regular administrators can still see the widget.

= 1.5.7 =
* The widget now displays log timestamps in local time instead of UTC.

* Tested up to WP 4.9-beta2.

= 1.5.4 =
* Fixed the error "can't use method return value in write context". It was a compatibility issue that only affected PHP versions below 5.5.

= 1.5.3 =
* You can send email notifications to multiple addresses. Just enter a comma-separated list of emails.
* Made sure that email notifications are sent no more often than the configured frequency even when WordPress is unreliable and triggers cron events too frequently.
* Tested up to WP 4.9-alpha-40871.

= 1.5.2 =
* Fixed a fatal error caused by a missing directory. Apparently, SVN externals don't work properly in the wordpress.org plugin repository.

= 1.5.1 =
* Added an option to ignore specific error messages. Ignored messages don't show up in the dashboard widget and don't generate email notifications, but they stay in the log file.
* Added limited support for parsing stack traces generated by PHP 7.
* Made the log output more compact.
* Improved log parsing performance.
* Fixed an "invalid argument supplied for foreach" warning in scbCron.

= 1.5 =
* Added a severity filter. For example, you could use this feature to make the plugin send notifications about fatal errors but not warnings or notices.
* Added limited support for XDebug stack traces. The stack trace will show up as part of the error message instead of as a bunch of separate entries. Also, stack trace items no longer count towards the line limit.

= 1.4.2 =
* Hotfix for a parse error that was introduced in version 1.4.1.

= 1.4.1 =

= 1.4 =
* Added an option to send an email notification when the log file size exceeds the specified threshold.
* Fixed a minor translation bug.

= 1.3.3 =
* Added i18n support.
* Added an `elm_show_dashboard_widget` filter that lets other plugins show or hide the error log widget.

= 1.3.2 =
* Tested up to WP 4.5 (release candidate).

= 1.3.1 =

* Added a different error message for the case when the log file exists but is not accessible.
* Only load the plugin in the admin panel and when running cron jobs.
* Fixed the error log sometimes extending outside the widget.
* Tested up to WP 4.4 (alpha version).

= 1.2.4 =
