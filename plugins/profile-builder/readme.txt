Powerful user profile plugin for creating front-end login, user registration and edit profile forms. Includes content restriction and user role editor.

== Description ==

**[Profile Builder](http://www.cozmoslabs.com/wordpress-profile-builder/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=pb-description-page&utm_campaign=PBFree) is the all in one user profile and registration plugin for WordPress.**

Easy to use [user profile plugin](https://www.cozmoslabs.com/154636-best-wordpress-user-profile-plugins-compared/) for creating front-end login, user registration and edit profile forms by using shortcodes.

**Restrict Content** based on user role or logged in status. Manage user roles and capabilities using the built in **Role Editor**.

[Profile Builder](https://www.cozmoslabs.com/1341-wordpress-profile-builder-a-front-end-user-registration-login-and-edit-profile-plugin/) lets you customize your website by adding a front-end menu for all your users, giving them a more flexible way to modify their user profile or register (front-end user registration).
Users with administrator rights can customize basic user fields or add custom user fields to the front-end forms.

To achieve this, simply create a new page and give it an intuitive name(i.e. Edit Profile).
Now all you need to do is add the following shortcode: [wppb-edit-profile].
Publish the page and you are done!

== Front-end User Registration, Login, User Profile and Password Recovery Forms ==
You can use the following shortcode list to display the forms:

* **[wppb-edit-profile]** - to grant users front-end access to their user profile (requires user to be logged in).
* **[wppb-login]** - to add a front-end login form.
* **[wppb-logout]** - to add logout functionality.
* **[wppb-register]** - easily register users via a front-end register form.
* **[wppb-recover-password]** - to add a password recovery form.
